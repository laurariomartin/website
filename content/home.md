### {{< fas "code" >}} Coding Experience
I use essentially Fortran 90 for coding my main projects with a touch of MPIf90 for parallel computing. I use python for very quick tests that do not require much performance and sometimes for post-processing. I also use Wolfram mathematica for long formal calculations and double-checking some theoretical developments.
